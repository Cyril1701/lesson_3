			<h1>Best Android Phones to Buy in 2022</h1>
		</div>
		<h2>Whether you want Google's new Pixel 7 or one of Samsung's best Galaxy phones, these are the best Android
			handsets you can buy right now.
		</h2>
		<div class="insidetext">
			<p>
				The Android phone world is peppered with some of the best mobile technology around. From Samsung's Galaxy
				<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review/" target="_blank">S22 Ultra</a>
				with its
				incredible zooming camera setup to Google's new <a
					href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/pixel-7-pro-review-googles-best-flagship-phone-gets-better/"
					target="_blank">Pixel
					7</a> series with its custom-made
				processor, there are exciting features to be found wherever you look. And it's not just at the expensive end
				where you'll find the best stuff either. <span>More and more manufacturers</span> have been focusing on the
				mid and lower
				ranges with phones like the Pixel 6A, Nothing Phone 1 and Samsung Galaxy A53 packing great features for more
				affordable prices.

				If you've got deep pockets and a passion for the most cutting-edge tech around, then you can even look
				toward Samsung's folding models, the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Z Flip 3. Those bending displays will certainly
				draw a few curious looks when you're out and about.

				But all those choices can also make the shopping experience overwhelming and confusing, which is why I've
				rounded up my favorite picks. <mark>These powerful Android phones</mark> all have generally great cameras,
				screens, battery life or all of the above. I also considered features such as 5G and wireless charging. Read
				on to see my top picks for the best Android phones and check out the best tips on how to buy a new phone,
				too. CNET's team updates this list periodically as we review new products.

			<h3>Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</h3>
		</div>

		<p>Like:</p>
		<ul class="spisok">
			<li>S Pen is included with the phone and there's a slot for storing it</li>
			<li>Great low-light photography</li>
			<li>Closer zoom than most competing phones</li>
			<li>Distinct design</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Don't like:
		</p>
		<ul class="spisok">
			<li>Expensive</li>
			<li>Cameras are mostly the same as on the Galaxy S21 Ultra</li>
			<li>Battery life isn't as long as the S21 Ultra</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="text">
			<p>The $1,200 Galaxy S22 Ultra is one of the most expensive Android phones out there, but for good reason. It
				has a giant 6.8-inch display, an S Pen stylus you can store inside the phone (just like the Galaxy Note),
				and a four-lens camera with a zoom range that's hard to beat. Samsung also improved the way all of its new
				Galaxy phones take photos in low light, which is especially important on a photography-oriented phone like
				the Ultra.

				The only downsides? The S22 Ultra's sky-high price and relatively short battery life. Still, the Galaxy S22
				Ultra is the best phone for people who want the biggest screen and one of the best cameras available in a
				smartphone. You just have to be willing to pay a higher price for those perks.

			<p>Google's latest flagship phone, the Pixel 7 Pro, isn't a huge overhaul from the already excellent Pixel 6
				Pro Google launched last year. But it's taken that winning formula and made some key tweaks to almost every
				element, resulting in a superb phone that's bliss to use. The refreshed camera can take stunning images too,
				earning its spot among the best flagship phones around. <a target="_blank"

			<h3>Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus</h3>
		</div>
		<h4>Like:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Bright screen</li>
			<li>Good balance of screen size and comfort</li>
			<li>Better camera with improved color and contrast</li>
			<li>Attractive design</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Don't like:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>$1,000 is still expensive for a phone</li>
			<li>Battery life isn't as long as the iPhone 13 Pro's</li>
			<li>No new built-in camera modes</li>
			<li>Fast charging requires a special $50 adapter</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="first-class second-class">
			<p>
				The $1,000 Galaxy S22 Plus has the right balance of size, performance and camera performance for most
				people. The 6.6-inch screen provides plenty of space for those who prefer larger-sized phones but feel like
				the Ultra might be too overwhelming (and expensive).<br> The upgrade to a 50-megapixel camera also makes a
				huge
				difference compared to last year's Galaxy S21 lineup, especially when it comes to color and contrast in
				photos.

				My biggest complaint is that the battery life was just mediocre, although it did outlast the regular Galaxy
				S22 and Galaxy S22 Ultra during CNET's battery test. It also would have been nice to see new features that
				take advantage of the S22's <mark>improved camera</mark>, especially since the S22 Plus is more expensive
				than several
				phones on this list. Still, the Galaxy S22 Plus has everything most people need in a new phone. Read our
				Galaxy S22 Plus review.

			<h3>Google Pixel 7</h3>
		</div>
		<h4>Like:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Sleek design</li>
			<li>Great value</li>
			<li>Main camera is Google's best</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Don't like:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Battery life is good but not great</li>
			<li>Not as much Android version support as Samsung</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="insidetext">
			<p>
				At around $600, the Google Pixel 7 offers a great way to put some of Google's best tech in your pocket
				without emptying your bank balance in the process. It undercuts the fully-specced 7 Pro model by some way,
				but still packs the same Tensor G2 processor, a glorious screen and a great main camera.

				Like the 7 Pro, it's had a refreshed design which looks classy and stylish, while its Android 13 software is
				clutter-free and easy to use. The battery life could be better, but with careful use you'll get through a
				day on a charge. It lacks the telephoto zoom and a couple of the other bells and whistles of the 7 Pro, but
				if you're after a solid everyday phone at a decent price, then the base Pixel 7 is a great option.

			<h3>Samsung Galaxy S22</h3>
		</div>
		<h4>Like:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Improved camera with better low-light photography</li>
			<li>Elegant design</li>
			<li>Great size for people who prefer smaller phones</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Don't like:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Battery life could be better</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="text">
			<p>Finding a smaller-sized Android phone is no easy task these days. Most phones come with screens that are at
				least 6.4 inches or larger, leaving people who prefer petite phones with few options. The $800 Galaxy S22
				checks that box. It has everything we loved about the Galaxy S22 Plus -- an eye-catching design, an
				excellent camera system with a 50-megapixel main lens and a sharp screen -- but in a more pocket-friendly
				size.

				Still, the Galaxy S22 falls short in the same area as its pricier siblings: battery life. I was able to get
				through a full day with the S22's refresh rate set to adaptive, which cranks it up to 120Hz for smoother
				scrolling, but only barely. That said, the S22's battery life might be enough for some people, especially
				those who spend most of their day at home or in the office with a charger nearby. The Galaxy S22 is
				otherwise a solid choice for any Android user, but especially those looking for a smaller-sized phone. <a

				The <a
					href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/oneplus-10-pro-review-great-android-phone-has-some-problems/">OnePlus
					10 Pro</a> earned a good score in our review thanks to its slick design, its powerful performance
				and its price tag, which undercuts its main rivals. It needs a few improvements -- most notably to the
				camera, which is good, but not great -- but this flagship offers a great overall experience. If you're after
				a <mark>top-end 5G phone</mark> that's a bit different to your friends' iPhones and Galaxy phones then it's
				a solid
				option to consider.

			<h3>Nothing Phone 1</h3>
		</div>
		<h4>Like:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Flashing design</li>
			<li>Solid performance</li>
			<li>Affordable price</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Don't like:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Cameras are only okay</li>
			<li>Not yet available in the US</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="text">
			<p>
				The Nothing Phone 1's affordable price, its solid performance and its good-enough camera setup already makes
				it a solid option to consider if you're looking for an Android phone on a budget. But this phone takes the
				pizzazz up a notch with its suite of flashing LED lights on the rear which certainly makes it stand out
				against its competitors.

				It's a great phone that we enjoyed reviewing, but there is a downside; As of right now, there's no plans to
				launch the phone in the US. UK shoppers can pick it up right now, but those of you in the US will have to
				simply keep your fingers crossed.

			<h3>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</h3>
		</div>
		<h4>Like:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>120Hz cover screen</li>
			<li>Water resistance</li>
			<li>Enhanced tablet experience</li>
			<li>Software improvements for multitasking and Flex Mode</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Don't like:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>$1,800 is still expensive</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Foldable phones haven't really hit the mainstream, remaining instead only in the reach of those willing to
			spend top dollar on the latest in mobile innovation. Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 4 is the best folding phone
			around, offering top-notch performance, a great camera setup and a variety of tweaks to its folding technology
			that make this Android smartphone more desirable than its predecessor.

			<h3>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4</h3>
		</div>
		<h4>Likes:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Better battery life than before</li>
			<li>Still the best flip phone to get into foldables</li>
			<li>Water resistance</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Dislikes:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Same cameras as the Galaxy Z Flip 3</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 is an iterative update but it packs a punch for the $1,000 price tag. With a better
			battery life thanks to a more power efficient processor and a bigger battery, the Flip is finally worth
			investing in as a flagship device.

			<h3>Sony Xperia Pro</h3>
		</div>
		<p>
			At a whopping price of $2,500, the Sony Xperia Pro isn't for everyone. But if you're a photographer or
			videographer looking for professional-level camera phone features, you can't go wrong. The Xperia Pro is
			essentially four products in one: a phone, a camera monitor, a speedy photo file transfer device and a 5G
			machine suitable for broadcasting and livestreaming. Read our Sony Xperia Pro review.
